        <h3><a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a></h3>
        Summary of resource:<br />
        Google Fonts has a catalog of fonts. More importantly, each font is open sourced 
        which means it has the appropriate licensing for use in any commercial project.<br />
        <br />
        The filters, on Google Fonts, allow you to find appropriate fonts for your project. 
        You can even generate sentences to see samples of the font. 
        My favorite feature is that you can download the entire font weight family. 
        This resource is perfect for any web developer or graphic designer. 
        Google Fonts also provides CSS rules and links for you to embed your chosen font.<br />

        <h3><a href="https://coolors.co">Coolors</a></h3>
        Summary of resource:<br />
        Coolors is a color palettes generator. There is also a catalog of trending color pallets.<br />
        <br />
        Coolors allows you to generate random colors that you can use to build and save your own color scheme.
        You can also generate colors pallets from a picture.
        This website is perfect for anyone trying to create a consistent color scheme throughout a project.
        My favorite feature is being able to save my color palette using RGB, HSB, or HEX code.
        This ensures that I will have a consistent color though all types of mediums.<br />

        <h3><a href="https://www.pexels.com">Pexels</a></h3>
        Summary of resource:<br />
        Pexels is a database of free stock images. All licenses are handled though Pexels. For purposes of web design, these pictures are perfect for use. 
        <br />
        All images are high quality. Pexels has a community of photographers that work with them to ensure the quality of each picture.
        Each image is easy to either download or export to Canva. It is encouraged to modify photos and videos. 
        It is appreciated but not required to give credit. 
        Because of this, I believe it is a great resource for adding imagery to your website.<br />

        <h3><a href="https://javascript.info">JavaScript.Info</a></h3>
        Summary of resource:<br />
        JavaScript.Info is basically a textbook on JavaScript. This website goes over simple to advanced concepts. <br />
        <br />
        Simple programs and instructions are used to teach each subject. 
        I enjoy using this website for simple tutorials because it keeps the information very general, not program specific. 
        This website will allow you to jump around from concept to concept as needed. 
        Because there is a table of context of each subject, it allows me to explore and learn something new that I can incorporate to my own projects. 
        I believe this is a great resource to refresh your memory and begin learning new concepts. <br />

        <h3><a href="https://web.dev/learn">Web.Dev</a></h3>
        Summary of resource:<br />
        Web.Dev is a powerhouse of information for full-stack web development.<br />
        <br />
        This website goes beyond basic teachings. For instance, the learning modules for privacy will teach you basic information on privacy protection. 
        The rest of that module will go in dealing with third parties, fingerprinting, encryption, and best practices.
        If you're looking to keep your projects up to date, this is the website for you. 
        My favorite feature of this website is that each course was developed by experts and members of the Google Chrome team. 
        So, although it is reading intensive, I can trust the information and know I am learning best practices for modern technology.<br />
